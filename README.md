# LabyrinthGame

A collaboration with Rowel Eshan and Darren Sin for ICS4U

This is a 4-player game tributed to the popular board game Labyrinth, which we created using Java. This game will feature a game board that contains 4 players and tiles, featuring featuring different treasures that must be attained. The players are given treasure cards, and the objective of each player is to land on the tile that has their treasure. Movement throughout the board is achieved by inserting a tile into movable rows & columns, or by moving the player through open paths. The winner of the game is the first player to obtain all of their treasures.

Added features: 
 - Pathfinding visualization (Rowel)
 - Saving and reloading of data (Murphy)
 - Animation of player movements (Darren)
